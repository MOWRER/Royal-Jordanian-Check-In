  <h2>Online Check-In with Royal Jordanian</h2>
  <p>One of the easiest and most convenient ways to check in is via <strong>Royal Jordanian’s online check-in</strong>. Available through the official website or mobile app, online check-in opens <strong>24 hours before departure</strong> and closes <strong>4 hours before the flight</strong> for most international destinations. This option allows passengers to confirm their flight, select or change seats, and add extra baggage if needed. You can also download and print your boarding pass or save it to your mobile device—saving time at the airport.</p>

  <h2>Mobile Check-In with the Royal Jordanian App</h2>
  <p>Travelers who prefer using smartphones can check in using the <strong>Royal Jordanian mobile app</strong>, available on Android and iOS. The app offers seat selection, baggage updates, and digital boarding pass generation. You can also receive flight notifications, gate details, and baggage claim updates on your phone—ideal for travelers on the go.</p>

  <h2>Airport Counter Check-In</h2>
  <p>If you prefer in-person service or require special assistance, <strong>Royal Jordanian airport check-in counters</strong> open about <strong>3 hours before international flights</strong> and <strong>2 hours before domestic flights</strong>. Check-in typically closes <strong>45 to 60 minutes prior to departure</strong>. It’s best to arrive early to ensure a smooth process through check-in and security.</p>

  <h2>Self-Service Kiosks</h2>
  <p>At select airports, <strong>Royal Jordanian self-service kiosks</strong> allow passengers to check in quickly and efficiently. These kiosks support seat selection, baggage check-in, and boarding pass printing. They’re especially helpful for passengers without checked baggage.</p>

  <h2>Baggage Check and Travel Tips</h2>
  <p>If you're checking in luggage, arrive early enough to complete your check-in and baggage drop. For <strong>international flights</strong>, baggage drop closes <strong>60 minutes before departure</strong>, and for <strong>domestic flights</strong>, at least <strong>45 minutes prior</strong>. Always confirm your baggage allowance and policies based on your destination and ticket type.</p>

  <p>Passengers traveling with oversized luggage, sports equipment, or pets should arrive even earlier to ensure proper handling. If you need special assistance, such as wheelchair access or medical services, notify the airline in advance and check in early for dedicated support.</p>
